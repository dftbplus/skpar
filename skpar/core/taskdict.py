    This is a callable object that plots to file the model and reference data
    associated with one or more objectives.
    The model and reference data constitute the Y-coordinates (ordinates).
    The X-coordinates (abscissas) are potentially held in a separate field of
    the model data dictionary, and implicitly it is assumed that the
    X-coordinates of the reference data are the same
    (else the model-vs-reference comparison would make no sense).
    The fundamental concept is that we want to visualise our objectives.
    So the ordinate can be obtained by the user's stating which objectives is
    to be visualised.
    The challenge is that a definition of objective contains no info about the
    abscissa, so it has to be explicitly specified by the user or else the
    default indexing of the reference or model data items will be used as
    abscissa.
    The whole mechanism must work with the simplest possible (default)
    plotting routine, as well as with a more specialised plotter object.
    The initialisation of the PlotTask should establish what dictionary
    items are to be plotted as abscissas and ordinates and from which
    model dictionary, and how the latter are matched to the corresponding
    reference data.
    Note however, that objectives may not be visible at the time the task is
    initialised. So at init time, we merely record the user's directions.
    Later – at call time – we do the data queries and call the plot function
    with the latest model data.
